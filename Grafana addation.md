# LifeTrack Monitoring with Actuator, Prometheus and Grafana

## Purpose

LifeTrack uses three monitoring layers:

```text
Spring Boot Actuator
    -> exposes application metrics
Prometheus
    -> scrapes and stores those metrics every 5 seconds
Grafana
    -> queries Prometheus and displays dashboards
```

Grafana is not a Maven dependency and it does not read the LifeTrack MySQL
database. It is a separate visualization server. Prometheus is also a separate
server. Only Actuator and Micrometer run inside Spring Boot.

Monitoring observes the application. It does not create expenses, Daily Logs,
journals or other business records.

## Current implementation

| Component | Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spring Boot Actuator | `backend/pom.xml` | Health and application metrics |
| Micrometer Prometheus registry | `backend/pom.xml` | Converts metrics into Prometheus format |
| Actuator configuration | `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` | Exposes selected endpoints and adds the application tag |
| Prometheus configuration | `monitoring/prometheus.yml` | Scrapes Spring every 5 seconds |
| Docker Compose | `monitoring/docker-compose.yml` | Runs Prometheus and Grafana |

The exposed Spring endpoints are:

```text
GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
```

The monitoring servers are:

```text
Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
Grafana:    http://localhost:3000
```

## Starting monitoring

Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop is running.
- Spring Boot is running on port `8080`.
- Ports `3000` and `9090` are available.

From the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location monitoring
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

`start-lifetrack.bat` does not start Prometheus or Grafana. They must be started
separately with this Compose command.

## Verifying each connection

### 1. Verify Spring metrics

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
```

The health endpoint should report `UP`. The Prometheus endpoint should return
plain-text metric names such as JVM, process and HTTP server measurements.

### 2. Verify Prometheus can reach Spring

Open:

```text
http://localhost:9090/targets
```

The `lifetrack-backend` target should be `UP`.

Prometheus runs inside Docker while Spring runs directly on Windows. Therefore
`monitoring/prometheus.yml` targets:

```text
host.docker.internal:8080
```

Using `localhost:8080` inside the Prometheus container would incorrectly point
back to the Prometheus container itself.

### 3. Connect Grafana to Prometheus

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Log in with the local development credentials:
   `admin` / `admin`.
3. Open **Connections → Data sources**.
4. Add **Prometheus**.
5. Set the URL to:

   ```text
   http://prometheus:9090
   ```

6. Select **Save & test**.

Grafana uses the Compose service name `prometheus` because both containers share
the Compose network.

## Useful PromQL queries

Generate some traffic first by logging in and opening Expenses, Daily Log,
Analytics and Journal.

### Is Spring reachable?

```promql
up{job="lifetrack-backend"}
```

Expected value: `1`.

### Requests per second

```promql
sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{application="lifestyle-ai-backend"}[1m]))
```

### Requests grouped by URI and status

```promql
sum by (method, uri, status) (
  rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{application="lifestyle-ai-backend"}[5m])
)
```

### Average request duration

```promql
sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_sum{application="lifestyle-ai-backend"}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{application="lifestyle-ai-backend"}[5m]))
```

### JVM heap memory in megabytes

```promql
sum(jvm_memory_used_bytes{application="lifestyle-ai-backend", area="heap"})
/ 1024 / 1024
```

### Process CPU usage

```promql
process_cpu_usage{application="lifestyle-ai-backend"} * 100
```

Prometheus metric availability depends on the current Spring/Micrometer version.
Use `http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus` or Prometheus autocomplete to
confirm exact names before creating a panel.

## Suggested interview dashboard

Create four small panels:

1. Backend availability: `up{job="lifetrack-backend"}`
2. Requests per second
3. Requests grouped by status
4. JVM heap memory

Then call a Spring endpoint from Swagger and show:

```text
Swagger request
    -> Spring controller
    -> Micrometer records the HTTP measurement
    -> Prometheus scrapes it
    -> Grafana displays the updated series
```

This demonstrates observability around an API request. It does not mean Grafana
traces the internal controller, service and repository methods individually.

## Stopping monitoring

To stop containers while preserving their current container state:

```powershell
docker compose stop
```

To restart them:

```powershell
docker compose start
```

To remove the containers:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

The current Compose file does not define persistent Grafana or Prometheus volumes.
Removing the containers can therefore remove locally configured dashboards and
stored monitoring data.

## Troubleshooting

### Prometheus target is DOWN

- Confirm Spring is running on port `8080`.
- Open `/actuator/prometheus` directly.
- Confirm Docker supports `host.docker.internal`.
- Check `docker compose logs prometheus`.

### Grafana cannot connect to Prometheus

- Use `http://prometheus:9090`, not `http://localhost:9090`, in the Grafana data
  source.
- Confirm both containers are running with `docker compose ps`.
- Check `docker compose logs grafana`.

### Port 3000 or 9090 is already in use

Stop the conflicting process or change the host side of the relevant port mapping
in `monitoring/docker-compose.yml`.

### Graphs are empty

- Generate requests against Spring.
- Increase the panel time range.
- Confirm the Prometheus target is `UP`.
- Verify the metric name in Prometheus before using it in Grafana.

## Security and production limitations

The current setup is for local development and academic demonstration:

- `/actuator/**` is permitted without JWT by `SecurityConfig`.
- Grafana uses default development credentials.
- Prometheus and Grafana ports are exposed on the host.
- monitoring data and dashboards have no configured persistent volume.
- TLS and service authentication are not configured.

Before public deployment, restrict Actuator exposure, secure Grafana, add network
controls and authentication, use secrets instead of committed defaults, and add
persistent volumes where required.

## Interview answer

> Actuator instruments the Spring Boot process, Micrometer exports those
> measurements in Prometheus format, Prometheus periodically scrapes and stores
> them, and Grafana queries Prometheus to visualize availability, traffic,
> latency and JVM behavior. Grafana never replaces MySQL and does not execute
> LifeTrack business logic.
